# ASE Testing Tool (Assignment)

A small Python project containing search algorithms (A\*, BFS, IDS, Simulated Annealing, LP/DP, heuristics) and a runner.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Run the main runner:

```bash
python runner.py
```

## Project structure

- `runner.py` — entry-point to run experiments
- `student_*.py` — student implementations
- `heuristics.py`, `common.py` — shared utilities
- `results/` — example outputs and metrics

## Requirements

This repo has no strict external dependencies; standard library should be enough. If you add packages, list them in `requirements.txt`.

## License

Add a license if you plan to share publicly.
